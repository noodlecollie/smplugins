== Spawn file system ==

Objective: To remove all info_player_teamspawn and func_respawnroom entities OnMapStart if a spawn file exists and is valid, then to re-populate the map with new info_player_teamspawn entities in order for players to spawn at these points.

File format
The spawn file for a map is held in the tf/scripts/dmspawn folder and is named "<mapname>_spawns.txt". It is a keyvalues file structured as follows:

"spawns"
{
	"n"	<- N is a unique integer, starting at 0.
	{
		"angles"		"x y z"		<- Vector.
		"TeamNum"		"2"			<- Team number 2 is Red, 3 is Blue.
		"position"		"x y z"		<- Where the spawn should be placed in the map. Not an entity keyvalue.
	}
}

Convars
dmspawn_enabled - default 1. Sets whether the plugin should be active on map start. If 0, no activity will occur.
