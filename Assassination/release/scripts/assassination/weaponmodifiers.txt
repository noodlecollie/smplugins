// Assassination weapon modifiers file.
// Weapon modifiers are intended to help balance the scoring by allowing certain kill to score more or less points than others.
// This file is ONLY loaded when the plugin starts for the first time, and is NOT loaded when a new map starts.
// If you make changes to this file while the server is running, either restart the server or unload/reload the plugin.

// This file is formatted with a list of keys and corresponding values.
// All weapon indices and values are found under the root branch "weapons".
// Each weapon should have its own sub-section with two key-value pairs inside: the weapon ID and the modifier value. The number assigned to the sub-section
// is unimportant but should be a unique integer. It is recommended to go up in consecutive integers, starting from 0, purely for neatness/personal reference.
// The "weaponid" key is the item definition index of the weapon (found in the TF2 Content GCF at tf/scripts/items/items_game.txt or at
// http://wiki.alliedmods.net/Team_Fortress_2_Item_Definition_Indexes). IDs start at 0 (Scout bat).
// The "modifier" key is the score modifier for the weapon. The modifier value should be formatted as a float (ie. the integer "2" would be written as "2.0").
// When the assassin is killed by the target (or vice-versa), the amount of points scored is the base value (found in nfas_assassin_kill_points and
// nfas_target_kill_points)	multiplied by the weapon modifier, multiplied by the kill type modifier. Kill type modifiers deal with whether the kill
// was a headshot, backstab, etc, and can be found in the following ConVars:
// nfas_headshot_multiplier			for headshots;
// nfas_backstab_multiplier			for backstabs;
// nfas_reflect_multiplier			for reflect projectiles;
// nfas_sentry_level1_multiplier	for level 1 sentries;
// nfas_sentry_level2_multiplier	for level 2 sentries;
// nfas_sentry_level3_multiplier	for level 3 sentries;
// nfas_telefrag_multiplier			for if a player is telefragged.

// If a weapon ID is not included in the file, its modifier is assumed to be 1 (no change).
// If the modifier value is less than 0, it is treated as 0.

// Entries are formatted as follows:
// "0"												<- Unique integer for the weapon sub-section
// {
//		"weaponid"		"0"							<- ID of the weapon
//		"modifier"		"1.5"						<- Value of the multiplier
// }

// Note that if the root "weapons" branch cannot be found, the file will NOT be read.

// ******************************************

// These are default settings; tweak to your liking.
