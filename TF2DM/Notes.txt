Classic deathmatch-style gameplay where weapons can be picked up.
Players begin with a default weapon specific to their class and can pick up different weapons that belong to their class.
Players respawn at deathmatch spawn points using the dmspawn plugin (packaged with tf2dm).

Weapon sets with slots 0-7, ammo provided by pickups.
Slot 0 is the starting weapon, slots 1-7 are pickups.
Pickups specify the weapon for each class.

Example weaponset format in scripts/tf2dm/weaponsets.txt:

"weaponsets"									// Root node.
{
	"setname"									// Unique string identifier of the weapon set. If the same as a previous name, the set will be ignored.
	{
		"name"	"Weaponset Name"				// Descriptive name of the weapon set, used in menus.
		"slot"									// Specifies that slot data is contained below.
		{
			"id"	        "0"					// Specifies the slot number. Will override configs for previously defined slots.
			"heavyweapons"  "100"				// Specifies the item definition index for the given class.
			"soldier"       "200"				// Class descriptors continue in the same fashion.
            ...
		}
		
		"slot"									// Slot descriptors continue in the same fashion. Undefined slots are assumed to be empty and will not be used.
		...
	}
}

Example map config in scripts/tf2dm/[mapname]_tf2dm.txt:

"mapconfig"						// Root node.
{
	"healthpack"				// Custom health packs:
	{
		"origin"	"x y z"		// Vector position for health pack.
		"size"		"2"			// 0 = small, 1 = medium, 2 = large.
	}
	
	"ammopack"					// Custom ammo packs:
	{
		"origin"	"x y z"		// Vector position for ammo pack.
		"size"		"2"			// 0 = small, 1 = medium, 2 = large.
	}
	
	"powerup"					// Power-ups:
	{
		"origin"	"x1 y1 z1"	// Multiple possible spawn points for the powerup.
		"origin"	"x2 y2 z2"
		...
		
		"type"		"crit"		// Power-up type: one of crit, minicrit, speed, defense, uber, cola.
		"duration"	"3"			// Duration of the power-up in seconds.
	}
