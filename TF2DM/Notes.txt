Classic deathmatch-style gameplay where weapons can be picked up.
Players begin with a default weapon specific to their class and can pick up different weapons that belong to their class.
Players respawn at deathmatch spawn points using the dmspawn plugin (packaged with tf2dm).

Weapon sets with slots 0-7, ammo provided by pickups.
Slot 0 is the starting weapon, slots 1-7 are pickups.
Pickups can either be a specific weapon (which must be defined for each class), a random primary/secondary/melee weapon, a completely random weapon or nothing.

Example weaponset format in scripts/tf2dm/weaponsets.txt:

"weaponsets"									// Root node.
{
	"setname"									// Unique string identifier of the weapon set. If the same as a previous name, the set will be ignored.
	{
		"name"	"Weaponset Name"				// Descriptive name of the weapon set, used in menus.
		"slot"									// Specifies that slot data is contained below.
		{
			"id"	"0"							// Specifies the slot number. Will override configs for previously defined slots.
			"heavyweapons"						// Specifies data relating to a specific class (same identifiers as tf_bot). "all" specifies all classes and cannot use specific weapons (specific will default to random).
			{
				"weapon"	"WEAPON_PRIMARY  WEAPON_SECONDARY"	// Multiple flags of WEAPON_SPECIFIC, _PRIMARY, _SECONDARY, _MELEE, _RANDOM or _NONE, separated by spaces. WEAPON_SPECIFIC overrides all other flags.
				"index"		"100"								// Only used with WEAPON_SPECIFIC; contains the item definition index to use for the weapon.
																// Multiple indices can be specified, separated with spaces, and a random index will be chosen.
			}
			
			"soldier"							// Class descriptors continue in the same fashion.
			...
		}
		
		"slot"									// Slot descriptors continue in the same fashion. Undefined slots are assumed to be empty and will not be used.
		...
	}
}

Example map config in scripts/tf2dm/[mapname]_tf2dm.txt:

"mapconfig"						// Root node.
{
	"healthpack"				// Custom health packs:
	{
		"origin"	"x y z"		// Vector position for health pack.
		"size"		"2"			// 0 = small, 1 = medium, 2 = large.
	}
	
	"ammopack"					// Custom ammo packs:
	{
		"origin"	"x y z"		// Vector position for ammo pack.
		"size"		"2"			// 0 = small, 1 = medium, 2 = large.
	}
	
	"powerup"					// Power-ups:
	{
		"origin"	"x1 y1 z1"	// Multiple possible spawn points for the powerup.
		"origin"	"x2 y2 z2"
		...
		
		"type"		"crit"		// Power-up type: one of crit, minicrit, speed, defense, uber, cola.
		"duration"	"3"			// Duration of the power-up in seconds.
	}
