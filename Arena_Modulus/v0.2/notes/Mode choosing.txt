My original thoughts for choosing a mode were that the handler would call a vote on all the game modes and the players would vote for their favourite mode. However, I'm thinking that this may not be ideal, mainly for the reason that if the players all go for one mode (or a small number of modes) then there wouldn't be much difference between the vote method and the random method, the other un-voted-for modes then being put into a random order. It might also be tiresome to cycle through lots of menu pages in order to choose the mode you want. Therefore, I think the easiest way to handle the mode selection would be to create a random queue of the modes and record how many times each of them has been played; the mode with the smallest number would be chosen from the list, and the count increased by 1 each time it is played. If the order needed to be randomised, the queue could be sorted at random and the count numbers would then be checked in a different order, the first lowest one taking priority over an equal count later on.
